    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shrimp Fra Diavolo, translated as 'brother devil' in Italian, earns its name with a spicy red pepper kick. Tender, succulent shrimp and al dente pasta are tossed in a rich, tomato based sauce embellished with garlic, good olive oil, white wine and fresh herbs. A truly memorable dish that you can prepare in about 30 minutes.

        The main thing I like to do differently is to toss the buttery shrimp and spicy tomato sauce with pasta. It makes this dish a satisfying meal on its own and ensures that you don't waste a drop of the silky sauce. And you don't need much pasta to make a perfect Shrimp Fra Diavolo, just a couple of ounces per person. It's a dish that tastes decadent, but won't expand your waistline.
