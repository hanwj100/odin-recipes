    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lemon Garlic Pasta delivers bold, vibrant flavor with minimal effort. It's the kind of pasta dish you turn to on busy weeknights when you want a satisfying dinner on the table in 20 minutes flat.</p>
    <p>Think of this as a lighter, brighter version of the classic Italian pasta recipe, Pasta al Limone. Here I've swapped out heavy cream for a mixture of olive oil and butter, to add richness without dulling the vivid lemon flavor. I've also added a touch of crushed red pepper along with traditional black pepper for extra kick.</p>
