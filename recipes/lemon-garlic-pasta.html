    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lemon Garlic Pasta delivers bold, vibrant flavor with minimal effort. It's the kind of pasta dish you turn to on busy weeknights when you want a satisfying dinner on the table in 20 minutes flat.</p>
    <p>Think of this as a lighter, brighter version of the classic Italian pasta recipe, Pasta al Limone. Here I've swapped out heavy cream for a mixture of olive oil and butter, to add richness without dulling the vivid lemon flavor. I've also added a touch of crushed red pepper along with traditional black pepper for extra kick.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <uo>
        <li>Dry Spaghetti Noodles</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Fresh Parsley</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
    </uo>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook spaghetti until firm to the bite (al dente), about 8 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta water.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat until sizzling. Add minced garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Once you've drained the pasta, set skillet with the garlic mixture over medium heat. Add drained, cooked pasta and Â¼ cup of reserved pasta water; toss to coat. Cook and stir until heated through, adding more pasta water if pasta seems too dry.</li>
        <li>Remove pasta from heat and stir in lemon zest and juice, and parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to serving bowl or platter; top with grated parmesan cheese and serve.</li>
    </ol>
